* Injections
- Fully capture the RFI situation/background noise, no one has done.
- Depending on RFI/sensitivities etc most published burst rates are probably incorrect
- Able to finally assign error bars to burst rates
- If we flux calibrate, we can give the real peak flux/fluence distribution (although the fluence distribution requires slightly different formalism that what I've done). Again, this accounts for the RFI/noise changes in the system
* Papers with a similar analysis
- Cui et al touched on this, however their analysis was quite crude (i.e. they just did something like detected pulse/missed fraction)

- Keane 2021 have discussed this concept as well, they calculate at what distance pulsars need to be to be detected as RRATs

- A lot of discussion about whether B0656+14 as a RRAT

* Simulations
** Using SNR in place of flux
- In the radiometer equation $SNR \propto flux$
- Can replace flux with SNR and it _should_ be okay
- Fluxes are hard to get for CHIME, and they have large error bars.
- SNR does not have/has negligible error bars as it is a direct consequence from our data
- Calibrate the automated pipeline
* Telescope response / Detection pipeline response

$\frac{1}{1+e^{k(x-x0)}}$
* mu=0.3 std=0.1 p=2 frac=0.001
This is right around our detection threshold

Results are okay, we certainly can say something, but not with super confidence
